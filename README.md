1. Dynamic To-Do List 
A staple for any developer. This project focuses on DOM manipulation: creating, reading, 
and deleting elements based on user input. 
* HTML: An input field and an "Add" button. 
* CSS: Styling lists, hover effects for buttons, and "checked" states for completed tasks. 
* JavaScript: Event listeners to capture clicks, appendChild() to add new tasks, and 
remove() to delete them.
